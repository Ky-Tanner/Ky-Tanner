# Hi, I’m Ky Tanner
### 🧪 Postdoctoral Researcher | 🌍 Environmental Data Scientist | 📊 Data Storyteller

I'm passionate about working with large data sets—particularly those tied to **air quality**, **meteorology**, and **clean energy transitions**. My goal is to translate complex patterns into meaningful, actionable insights using clean visualizations and statistical modeling.

## 🔬 Current Work

🧭 **NIH-funded research in rural Rwanda**  
I'm investigating how personal air quality exposure relates to:
- Spaciotemporal variation during the transition from traditional to clean household energy
- Demographics (e.g. age, gender, occupation)
- Ambient pollutant concentrations
