### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ky, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University. I love exploring large data sets with clean, illuminating visualizations and statiscical models, particularly in the spaces of air quality, meteorology, and clean energy. I have a lot of experience working in R and have published several papers using data curated with this platform. I also have experience in Python (with machine learning aplications), linux, C++, and Matlab.
