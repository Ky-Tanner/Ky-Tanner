# 👋 Hi, I’m Ky Tanner
### 🧪 Postdoctoral Researcher | 🌍 Environmental Data Scientist | 📊 Data Storyteller

I'm passionate about working with large data sets—particularly those tied to **air quality**, **meteorology**, and **clean energy transitions**. My goal is to translate complex patterns into meaningful, actionable insights using clean visualizations and statistical modeling.

---

## 🔬 Current Work

🧭 **NIH-funded research in rural Rwanda**  
I'm investigating how personal air quality exposure relates to:
- Ambient pollutant concentrations
- Demographics (e.g. age, gender, occupation)
- Spaciotemporal variation during the transition from traditional to clean household energy

## 🧰 Skills & Tools

**Languages**:  
`R` | `Python` | `C++` | `Matlab` | `HTML`

**Tools & Platforms**:  
`Linux` | `RStudio` | `Jupyter` | `Git` | `GitHub` | `LaTeX`

**Focus Areas**:  
- Statistical modeling (GLMs, GAMs, mixed models)  
- Time series & spaciotemporal analysis  
- Interactive visualizations (Shiny, Streamlit, Plotly)  
- Reproducible research workflows
